# 🌟 Dynamic Greeter - Interactive Personalized Greetings

A modern, interactive web application that creates personalized greetings based on user input, time of day, and current date. Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.

## 🎯 Project Overview

Our plan is to build an interactive and personalized greeting program that precisely adapts to each user and the moment they run it. We leverage datetime functionality to recognize the exact time of day and current date, combined with robust conditional logic to craft unique messages.

- **Personalized Messages**: Special greetings for specific names (David, Admin, Alice, Bob, Guest)
- **Day-Specific Enthusiasm**: Different motivational messages for each day of the week
- **Dynamic Context**: Shows current date, time, and personalized statistics
- **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Modern UI/UX**: Beautiful gradient design with smooth animations

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend Logic**: Python (for command-line version)
- **Design**: Modern gradient UI with responsive grid layouts
- **Animations**: CSS transitions and JavaScript-powered interactions
